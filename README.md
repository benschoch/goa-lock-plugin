## Lock file support for [goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa)

### Description
This is a plugin for [goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa) that provides a similar concept of lock file creation, that you might already know from package managers such as [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) or [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md#lock-file).

The idea behind this concept is to ensure that the code that is not part of your repository, is still in the expected state and does not change in your CI/CD process.

By enabling this plugin within your goa setup, you will get a file created in your output directory, called `goa.lock` when you execute your `goa gen` command.  
This file can be used within your CI/CD to validate that the generated code didn't change accidentally.

### Enable plugin
Plugins for goa are enabled via [import for side effects](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#blank_import), which looks something like this:
```go
package mygoadesigns
    
import (
    // import plugin for side effects on `goa gen`
    _ "module github.com/benschoch/goa-lock-plugin"
)
```

Please refer to the [goa docs](https://goa.design/extend/plugins/) for more details.

### How to use in CI/CD

The simplest example to include a lock file validation into your is via `git diff`.  
First of all, you have to include the `goa.lock` file into your repository and exclude all other files generated by `goa gen`.

For example, if your project structure looks like this:
```
my-app/
├─ gen/
│  ├─ ...
│  ├─ goa.lock
├─ design/
│  ├─ api.go
├─ .gitignore
├─ go.mod
├─ ...
```

You could have a `.gitignore` similar to this:
```
/gen/*
!/gen/goa.lock
```

And now you could run `git diff --exit-code gen/goa.lock` which returns an exit code `0` if the file didn't change and otherwise `1`.

That exit code can then be used accordingly within your preferred CI/CD pipeline tool.
